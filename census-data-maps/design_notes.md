# Design Notes
## Sept 6 2018
currently building notebooks that will plot single variables across block groups
enhancement might be to take in an array of measures keyed by geo id and generate maps for all the measures
the array of measures could be across time or across different measures
the code could generate an array of plots using matplotlib functionality or just a sequence of maps (easier)
